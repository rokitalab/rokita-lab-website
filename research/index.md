### OpenPBTA and OpenPedCan

With Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation’s [Childhood Cancer Data Lab](https://www.alexslemonade.org/childhood-cancer-data-lab), Dr. Rokita co-led the creation of the [Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37492101/), an open-source reproducible analysis platform consisting of nearly 50 scalable modules to analyze pediatric brain tumor data and currently leads its pan-cancer expansion counterpart, the [Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) Project](https://github.com/d3b-center/OpenPedCan-analysis). 
These platforms became the foundational data layer of the [NCI’s pediatric Molecular Targets Platform](https://moleculartargets.ccdi.cancer.gov/) and are used to support clinical trial decision-making for the [Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC)](https://pnoc.us/), therapeutic development, and discovery and translational research.
